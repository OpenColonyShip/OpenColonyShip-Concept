Hey, Sam here

I don't really know how GitHub really works at the moment, so I apologise if this
is not how I am supposed to message everyone.

However, I just was wondering if it would be better to make a 2D game and write
the engine ourselves. We could choose a programming language that everyone is
familiar with, such as JavaScript.

Also, it is the first game, so I think it would make some sense to do it 2D. It
would make designing game art so much easier, and we could create particle effects,
too.

The other thing to consider is that by writing the game with JavaScript, we have the
ability to make the game web-accessable.


Hopefully I haven't upset you all!
